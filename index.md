## Favorite CPSC 120L labs

* Lab #3 Part 2
This lab was fun to me mainly because it involved a calendar which sounds a little weird. Although it was
difficult it was fun creating my own Julius calendar in the code and figuring out how to make one including
leap years. I felt a sense of success when the code worked and was able to calculate the date differences
between the starting date and the end dates.

* Lab #4 Part 2
I enjoyed doing this lab because it was a fun little game that we were able to play. The Hi Lo game was a
to start using the if loops and if else loops as well. I wish that we were able to make the game continue
until we finally guessed it instead of only getting two tries. With this lab however, I will have a
little head start when it comes to programming other games and maybe more complicated ones as well.

* Lab #7 Part 1
This lab was actually very fun to code although difficult. It added a lot of bool's in there and testing
mulitple true or falses within the if statements. I also did enjoy adding many if statements and else
if statements so we can code when you're allowed to park in those streets.
